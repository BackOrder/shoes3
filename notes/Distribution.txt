Federales Distribution

There will be several versions of Shoes/Linux Federales

Loose Shoes: 
  Uses system (or rvm if built from source) Ruby and gems & rbconfig. 
  No packaging ability, no ext's or builtins. 
  No LD_LIBRARY_PATH silliness. Links against system libraries - no need
  to copy libraries and muck around. 
==> FIXED Default linux build. 
==> Don't copy the ruby/lib to shoes ? 
==> Problem with Gems. 
      CONSTANT Whines from rubygems.rb (s) 
      It would be nice not to copy the ruby/lib/* to dist/. Related?
      gem env (-g env) is oddly different. Version #, and 
      RUBY_EXECUTABLE still has the ../shoes --ruby
==> FIXED:  define a Shoes::RELEASE_TYPE constant which is a string of
     "TIGHT_SHOES" or "LOOSE_SHOES"
==> ftsearch ext and gem need to be gemified (rake-compiler)
FIXED: Write 'rake install' and gnome launcher. Put in
    ~/.shoes/federales along with shoes.rb and lib, static, etc
     Foo. Ubuntu 13.10/Cinnamon ignores .local/share/applications
     and you have to sudo to copy to /usr/share/applications.
==> Should shoes be installed 
===> Distribute as .deb with a launcher?


======= Tight Shoes =====
Tight Shoes: Similar to todays Shoes. 
  Includes a sandboxed ruby, and any ext's and gems deemed interesting.
  Requires a purpose built ruby and uses cross compiling features. 
  Requires arch specific system libs be specified
==>FIXED Sandbox tested. No Constant whines from ruby or gems
==>FIXED TGT_DIR - rake clean needs to clean the right dir.
==>find_and_copy_deps need to be arch specific like {TGT_DIR} pointing 
  to /home/cross/x86_ or /home/cross/armv6-pi. Set TGT_SYS_DIR manually,
==> linux:setup:xxxx should actually verify that the cross compiled need
   libraries are available and set TGT_SYS_DIR there. For now, do it
   in xxxx_env.rb


Includes an embedded Ruby 1.9.3. It is distributed as a .deb (Ubuntu, Debian)
The installer will check for dependencies (gtk2-dev for example) and install them.
Shoes will be installed in ~/.shoes/federales/apps/ [that would contain all of dist/*]
It includes a gnome panel launcher that points to it with icon of course.
The Shoes splash screen will have entries for Open an app, Save App as 
.Shy (or whatever the Shoes4 folks use: Zip?) 
The user would have to install any gems manually 

A separate distribution (.deb), "Cobbler", will require a Shoes install and
will include a ShoesGems app and a ShoesPackage app (scripts in Shoes) with 
additional requirements for gems (fpm,bundler...) and systems libs
(including gcc tool chain, ruby dev, rvm? ...).

Obviously, I need an icon: The Shoes icon with a background of the Mexican Flag?
Sort of have one - shoes-icon-federales.png. 
==> The background is not transparent. 
==> FIXED: App.yaml has to know about the icon file name.  
==> Will need a shoes.desktop file (ie launcher) in 
~/.local/share/applications
  
ShoesGems - Cobbler?
  installs gems into the shoes directory (~/.shoes/federales/gems/). It should
be able to copy them from an existing system/rvm gems directory, detect native 
gems and compile them. It could use and/or create bundler gemsets?
