OSX rake steps/tasks (as of June/2/14)

Old Shoes : In Rakefile 
   in order with funky syntax to explain. These are rake tasks.
   build_tasks:pre_build
   :build_skel
   "#{dist}/#{shoes}"		# compiles and builds shoes-bin
   "#{dist}/VERSION.txt
   copy_files_to_dist,		# copys static, samples, etc
   :common_build, 			# builds exts, shoes gems if any
   :copy_pango_modules_to_dist # copies pango-modules and pango-querymodules
   :copy_deps_to_dist, 		# Create list of all libs used by shoes-bin,
			# and pango-querymodules and all libs used by those libs
			# checking for duplicates. Then copies them
   :change_install_names, 	# from a list of shoes-bin, pango-querymodeles, 
			# all dylibs and pango/modules/*.so do the install_name_tool
			# dance of -id and -change for each lib use (and subordinates)
   :setup_system_resources, 
   :verify
   
Loose Shoes (in Rakefile)
   build_tasks:pre_build	# sets up path structure for dist/lib/ruby/n.n.n/x86_64-
   :build_skel
   "#{dist}/#{shoes}"		# compiles and builds shoes-bin
   "#{dist}/VERSION.txt
   copy_files_to_dist,		# copys static, samples, etc
   :common_build, 			# builds exts, shoes gems if any - copy to
        # dist
   #:copy_pango_modules_to_dist # copies pango-modules and pango-querymodules
   #:copy_deps_to_dist, 		# Create list of all libs used by shoes-bin,
			# and pango-querymodules and all libs used by those libs
			# checking for duplicates. Then copies them
   #:change_install_names, 	# from a list of shoes-bin, pango-querymodeles, 
			# all dylibs and pango/modules/*.so do the install_name_tool
			# dance of -id and -change for each lib use (and subordinates)
   :setup_system_resources, 
   #:verify
   NO INSTALLER/PACKAGER - Error message instead
    

Tight Shoes (in make/mavericks/tasks.rb, env.rb)
   :pre_build, 
   :build_os
    Then the following procedures (functions in tasks.rb)
    common_build			# builds exts, shoes gems if any
    copy_files_to_dist		# copys static, samples, etc
    copy_deps_to_dist
      copy_pango_modules 	# copies pango-modules and pango-querymodules
      # Create list of all libs used by shoes-bin,
	  # and pango-querymodules and all libs used by those libs
	  # checking for duplicates. Then copies them
      change_install_names, # from a list of shoes-bin, pango-querymodeles, 
			# all dylibs and pango/modules/*.so do the install_name_tool
			# dance of -id and -change for each lib use (and subordinates)
    Builder.setup_system_resources
    
    Need to copy and process the ruby dependent libs like openssl.bundle
    bundle is the key ext. (in pre build where ruby is copied)
