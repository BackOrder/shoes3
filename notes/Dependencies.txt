Dependecies - Deps. (aka deps and DEPS)
  This an ugly problem for cross compiling. It needs to be more developer
  friendly if you are going to distribute binaries that work.
  
  For a 'build from source' configuration, the deps would be all the
  apt-get or yum commands to execute before attempting a compile. 
  build-essential, gtk+-2-dev, curl-dev, jpeg-dev, ...., ruby-1.9.3 
  These deps could be part of the distribution (a .deb) or as now, just 
  a list on the website. Whatever is current for the users Linux. 
  
  For a binary Shoes distribution, it's more controlled and complex 
  because of the control. Think of the MingW32 version. It had a crapload
  of DLL's bundled up in the Shoes install package.  We have to do the
  same thing for Linux - include the shared libraries that the user might
  not have or different versions from what he does have.
  
  Gtk is an issue here. Gtk2 is not installed on Raspbian, Debian Wheezy(7.1),
  or Ubuntu 13. Gtk3 is the new normal.  
  Although the Shoes Gtk3 code has some problems, it is good enough to run
  many of the samples and if I can't get Gtk3 working, it's all in vain,
  anyway.
  
  So, the cross compiles will only use GTK3 and include libraries for libs
  the user might not have (requires building ruby, curl, jpeg, ungif from source
  and for Windows - (Mingw32/64) gobject, glib, many more).  
  
  This link explains it better than I.

  Note: For debian based linux, schroot and debootstrap works really
  well for building a 32 app on a 64 bit system. 

ZLIB ? SSL? 
  Does Shoes/curl really need this? Disabled in curl for now.
  
CURL
  Then there is libcurl.so  I'd rather not deal with ssl configurations
  so the curl to be included is pretty damn minimal.  
  I'm hoping Shoes users won't notice or care.
  
RUBY  
  libruby.so - It really has to be compiled from source if you
  want to distribute a binary shoes and it has to be compiled correctly.
  I also had to install libyaml-dev and then build ruby.
==> Add /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libyaml-0.so.2
   
UNGIF - GIF
  every modern linux has libgif.so and libungif is just a link to it. 
  Or vice versa. I don't care deeply about old Political Correctness.
  Copy both of them.  

JPEG 
  Yes, not every linux has a complete jpeg library. 

GLib, Gobject and it's kinfolk. 
  It's highly likely that curl is going to depend on Glib (as does Shoes)
  Pick a version. Build everything against that and include the libraries
  with shoes, even if you think they aren't needed. Glib has some weird
  internal versioning mechanism. Don't fight it.

Cairo, Pango & cairoopango
  Sadly cairo.h is not part of Wheezy bare bones install.
  Yes, include them because you don't know if the users linux has the 
  versions we compiled against. 
  
Gtk 
  If I stick with Gtk+-2 then it's libs has to be included. 
  I wonder if Gtk3 works well enough on Windows for shoes.
