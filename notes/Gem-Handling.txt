GEM Management

 Shoes (cache.rb) stuffs it's gem dirs into the $: env variable. It might
be interesting to contemplate a small (yaml?) file in dist/ that overrides
these settings with the users choice of gemdirs. There is a ~/.shoes and
it does contain +gem and +lib directories where 'shoes -g gem install xxxx'
puts things. It sort of works. Not well, but it works.

It's more confusing. Shoes is pulling libs/gems out of my rvm directories. 
HUH? I only talked about that, I don't remember doing anything about it!
Why isn't shoes self contained? Env Vars? Might explain the multiple
console messages about attempting to set Constants twice with rbconfig.rb
RVM induced love for lost Ruby?

I wrote a Shoes script 'info-startup.rb' that displays/logs the startup
Ruby environment. It works in my Shoes/Ruby-1.9.1 and Shoes/Ruby-1.9.3
and it shows that shoes embedded ruby (1.9.1 or 1.9.3) is finding the rvm
libraries/gems. Fortunately, it's finding the right ones but it shouldn't
be poking around in rvm or system rubys. 

I suspect GEM_PATH and/or PATH is the env var that needs cleaning up in
cache.rb. For my purposes its a feature, not a bug. A feature to enable 
after it's no longer a bug. I can also see how this might be a problem
for cross compiled Shoes (mingw or Pi/armel)

Fixed: set GEM_PATH to GEM_DIR - stops loading gems from rvm rubies. 

Still loading some ruby stuff from rvm dirs.
===>  Right at the top of shoes.rb, the $" list points to rvm so it
   it's something in shell ENV or where ruby looks at init. Well before
   cache.rb can patch/hack things. Can't be fixed by patching shoes
   rbconfig - I think it's compiled in 
   
====> Indeed I tried linking shoes to the dist/libruby.so and it still
  grabs from the .rvm  ruby. Need to build my own ruby. 
====> See CrossCompiling.txt
   
====> Rakefile uses rbconfig settings for linking against the installed
  ruby instead of the target ruby.
 


Want to get rid of the shoes/setup.rb stuff for gems eventually and
manage the gems with a purpose build shoes app.

Fixed: Someone loads shy.rb - shoes.rb is a little too agressive. 
  Minor problem unless your cpu/disk is really slow. Still it ought
  not to. 

There is no Ruby versioning for ~/.shoes/gem+ For example Shoes will
try to load serialport.so and whine about libruby1.8. As it should.


  shoes/setup.rb also requires rubygems and rubygems/dependecies-installer
one or both of those includes rbconfig and I don't want that.
