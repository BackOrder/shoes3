Bugs/Status - stick with Ruby 1.9.3 and gtk2 until things get sorted
  out with GKt3
  
2014-02-08
done: tweak Rakefile and app.yaml 
     NOTE: NOTE: I've modified app.yaml to have major-minor-tiny and
     modified the Rakefile to use them and still be backward compatible
     if an OSX developer should appear. Or a Windows developer. 
done: use cron job to apt-get update chroots: ~/bin/update-chroots
    Source a script on chroot "user" login, interactive or from cron.
    .bach_profile copy of .bashrc and some edits to source ~/bin/bash-chroot 
done: sets things up for debx86 and deb386 
-->  but doesn't work for debrpi. Not a big deal for the pi.
done: If that works, I should be able to build x86_64 and i686 Shoes from
    cron.
done: Write a cron job to build the raspberry pi Shoes.
-->  Write a cron job to build the MinGW Shoes (native, and gtk2)

    manual-en.txt has 3 Japanese characters at line 470 that iconv claims
    is an invalid sequence. They look fine to me, terminal and editor
    and Ruby 1.9.3. Why would that choke Ruby 2?  Easy way to test: Make
    a backup, edit the file and see - I See that isn't the problem. Time
    to instrument deeper.
    diff ft1.log ft2.log
    273c273
    < FragFinish! 127439 127439
    ---
    > FragFinish! 126991 127439
    That's the fulltext.size and fulltext.bytesize values for
    Ruby [1].9.3 and [2].0.0
    
    Now I just have to find where that matters.  Like maybe that sort_by?
    You think? Sadly, that didn't fix it. But, I know what I need to look
    for [stringio].size. On a educated guess I set 
      util.rb in initialize_in_memory_buffer
      @memory_io.set_encoding("ASCII-8BIT")
done: IT WORKS. In 1.9.3 and 2.0.0. And it makes sense:  It's a binary file
     using pack, unpack so anything unicode aware should not think it's
     UTF-8 (a default for 2.0.0). 
--> Remove the debugging code in ftsearch/lib, help.rb, search.rb

 
2014-02-06
    back to ftsearch and 2.0 @memory_io has a different size in 2.0
    by the time the error is reported. Lets figure out where it's changed.
    I also know the number of loaded bytes from the source file is the same,
    and the numbers of sections,methods,mindex,suffixes (in help.rb) is 
    the same.
    
--> in fragment_writer.rb:101 dumping fulltext to disk (f.write) produces 
    in both Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.0.0 identical files 127439 bytes long.
    BUT ruby's size method returns different values for 2.0.0 - 126991
    but in 1.9.3 they are the same.  In both, the file produced is the same
    127439 and no diff for the files.  A difference of 448. The question is
    why ruby 2.0 does that. fulltext is a (mem)file from pack calls. they are the 
    same in the buffer - not the same when ruby asks for size.
    Do I suspect encoding? Hell yes. Ftsearch knows nothing about UTF-x, it
    wouldn't be hard to confuse it. 
    
    Opening the manual in "UTF-8" or "ASCII-8BIT " gets the same error in 2.0
    Opening the manual with "US-ASCII" gets an invalid byte sequence. Do
    I suspect some CP-1252 crap? Do I vaguely remember this was a problem
    discussed on the mailing list and not fixed the way I would like? Maybe.
    
--> don't use Shoes.read_file for the manual at help.rb:215. I think in 
    Ruby 2, everything is UTF-8. That just helps isolate the problem.
--> Clean out the Windows characters in manual-en.txt. (iconv cmd line?)

    Now that setup works and jailbreak, Do we really need better gem 
    handling? Not for linux. Osx isn't a consideration until someone 
    steps up to that task. There's no Shoes solution if the user doesn't
    have the build environment to compile gems, although gems are appearing
    that have mulitple arch binaries inside. 
  
2014-02-05
done:? Rakefile changes for linking to lib/shoes works oddly. rake clean
   can delete it and/or two rakes in a row. I might have fixed this.

done: Setup.rb works with 1.9.3 and 2.0.0
   Bluecloth is not very good sample to download a gem that can't be built
   on most windows, many OSX?. There are binarys gems for some windows though
   if you bump the bluecloth version up. 
   
   Of course RbConfig can be damn near useless for Shoes that move
   around in the file system. 
   
done: can compute the progress bar better - we know the inital size and the
    the amount (bytes) downloaded so far at each update()
  
2014-02-04
   Shoes.setup
     ex: Gem.source_index.refresh! . Not only was source_index deprecated
     it was deleted and there isn't much on the net about how to replace it.
done: $ dist/shoes -g list --local now working. by commenting out #27
     in setup.rb where it installs the 'sources' gem. So what does sources 
     do? Good Question it's base64 encoded (see notes/Gem-Handling.txt)
     I don't think its needed for modern Rubys. 
     
-->  Need to test setup with jailbreak y/n
     Shoes.setup do
        gem 'bluecloth =2.0.6'
done I seem to have a shoes/setup.rb that is buggy or incomplete.
 
done: It's got a blueshoes icon - where is that dialog created?
    Right there at setup.rb:47 dumb shit.
    
done: terminal reports a couple of [:download_reporter] messages
   and then an undef method 'fetch' for nil from net/http via 
   rubygems/request.rb:139 in block fetch. 
   HINT:
   gem list --remote bluecloth
       BlueCloth (1.0.1)
       bluecloth (2.2.0, 2.1.0 x86-mingw32 x86-mswin32)
hint: there's a shit load of bluecloth versions available. None of them
    install. 
done: So which bluecloth ? >= 2.0.6 perhaps? - makes a slight difference.
    It really can't handle multiple possibilities. Actually it can. 
    It's more explicit now but it still fails to download. At least
    I know where and what I'm feeding it.
    
    I suspect that the :download_reporter callbacks are not wired into
    the Setup Gui properly and it tries again after the connection is 
    closed. Just a guess.
   

  
2014-02-03
done: Save the manual issues for the Mailing list or the Meetup.

   Started looking at the gems problems - Ruby 2.0 forces this. 1.9.3 too
   A lot of changes. It doesn't look *too hard*, just tedious. 
   
done? So I don't want to build shoes every time I edit shoes.rb or setup.rb
   Can I set up symbolic links instead of copying files and then when
   installing, copy them? Add 'pre_build' task and the use 'copy_files_to
   dist' as dependency of install (removing any softlinks first)? 
   Watch out for lib/ruby/... Still need 'common_build' to copy that. 
   This is fragile - if you don't get it exactly correct then you
   can end up without lib/shoes.rb or lib/shoes.  Make backups if you play
   here. It's easy to do it wrong. Just Ask how I know that.
    
  
2014-02-02
done: US-ASCII problem loading manual which is the hardcoded 1.9 test
   in Shoes. But thats not the only problem. Now, 2.0.0 throws a hissy
   in sort_by (the tsize value is different 126991 for Ruby 2 and 
   127439 for 1.9.3) which suggests that something is not parsing 
   correctly. Both load the same number (str.length) of 112844 'things'
   Oddly enough file sz is a bit larger 113073.  Best not to worry about
   that oddity. Both have the same number of sections, methods, mindex.
   
   In ftsearch/lib/util.rb is the data method of fulltext_writer. It's
   a StringIO.new stored in @memory_io. So, something previous to that
   is writing more/or less data to @memory.io. Good Luck with that Cecil!
   Is it possible a flush() is needed? It's less than 512 thingies diff.
   Not likely. its fsync() before close. flush changes nothing. 
   
   Back out. Restate the problem. Fails inside 
    search.rb:20 - @index.finish! ->
    fragment_writer.rb:101  - > 
    suffix_array_writer.rb:48 (fulltext differs) -> sort, sort_by
   
   Can I use the Shoes 4 code for manual? Surely they reimplemented this
   nightmare? No ? There's a commit for 1.9.x hash syntax which might
   be helpful (and about the right size) - seems like a stretch.

2014-02-01
   What to tackle next?
--> Gkt3
--> Gem Manager (for binary, windows versions of Shoes)
--> cron updates/upgrades for chroots
--> smarter building of Shoes/ruby exts - or convert them to gems
--> update the many wiki pages about building from source. Assuming
    my commits are merged into the mainline. 
    
    Update to Ruby 2.0 (Gtk2) 
done: Source build on Linux (aka Loose Shoes) can use Ruby 2.0.0
    There's a lot of reasons not to do the following anytime soon.
--> Binary build for x86
--> Binary build for i686
--> Binary build for pi
--> Binary build for MinGW

I'm leaning towards the Ruby 2.0 work (at least for the default build)
  mostly because it could purge some known uglies in the rakefiles/cache.rb
  and it might help Windows Threading (or not). 
done: Add checks for RUBY_VERSION make/linux/env.rb
done: Loading ftsearch fails. cache.rb - it even said FIXME: in the code.
     

2014-01-31 Misc cleanup. Declare Milestone - b2 next? 

done: Review/close open bugs in this file.
done: commit and issue pull. May God help Steve in his time of need.

2014-01-30 Linux Desktop - ick.
    Of Course. There's a spec for those .desktop files and where they
    belong. Sort of. Fedora implements differently. Sigh.
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s02.html
    
done: Best to just copy to /usr/share/applications and let the user figure
    it out.  Using gksu to copy the desktop file.  Nope. gksu not available
    on OpenSuSe or Fedora and sudo is isn't bare Debian. Just su it is.
    
done: for .desktop files the category is 'Development' not 'Programming'
    Which debians may show as Programming. Or Not.  Grr. 
    
done: Raspberry Mostly OK. In Education and Programming menu, not in Others?
    Others is for apps that don't have pre-defined categories. 
    Who knew?
    
done: Copy the su/desktop stuff in the default [dist] install. 

done: Debian 7.2 (32 bit) Works. In Programming menu. Bless Debian.
done: OpenSuse/64/XFCE - Working. Menu item is under 'Development' 
done: Fedora 20 - Works on the strange Unity like desktop. Search for Shoes
    drag it to Activities.  
  
2014-01-29 
    Finish raspberry install script (cp, sed), deb creation.
    Grr - bundler leftovers. I'm not going to tie shoes to a shit load 
done: of gems it doesn't need.  Renamed Gemfile(s). fpm now works.
    
done:  Remove the :build task from packaging (deps can be wrong arch) 
    plus it's not helpful for testing deb. Already enough trouble with that
    
done: dpkg needs to be root. installs pkg in / and USER is root, plus HOME
    may not be where I want. Not sure what to do. deb/rpm isn't it
    unless I want shoes in /usr/lib/, /usr/local, /opt or such. Not that
    it couldn't be done, trivally. Just not what I want.
    
    Makeself.sh is pretty clever but can it deal with moving the
    shoes.desktop file to where it should go?  Raspberry does have gksu
    so other linux probably do too. 
done: add 'AddType application/x-makeself .run' to .htaccess at 
    www.mvmanila.com
    
done: generate bash script to run after .run is executed on users system



  
2014-01-28
    All the gtk3 linux seem to have the needed gkt2 libs so no additional
    deps for deb/rpm to deal with.  All that worry and delay for nought?
    
done Install basic Raspbian on SDcard.  Build raspberry shoes. 
done Doesn't look like I built gdbm in the Pi chroot. libgdbm-dev
done Rebuild ruby (that'll take a while). Still amazed that qeumu works.

    Then we can test what dependencies are needed.  Freaking none. 
    I should be happy that I won't have to learn and test fpm built
    debs and rpms that have dependecies. 
    NOTE: Pi version of Shoes uses my minimal curl compile. 
 
  
2014-01-27
    rather than deal with Windows and Threads I'll do something more
    Linux useful - fpm packaging of debs and rpms. 
Done build i386 versions of Shoes/Gtk2.
    It *appears* that the libgtk2 libraries are in Debian 7.2/386 but not
    part of any 'package' to remove (install presumably does nothing)
    There are no additional dependencies for Debian 7.2. Shoes/gtk2/i686 
    works fine. OpenSuSe 13.1(64) doesn't have 32 bit libs.
Done build x86_64 version of Shoes/gtk2. Works on opensuse and fedora.
    No additional dependencies for deb/rpm. 
 
2014-01-25 
    More thinking about windows threading issues with ruby. I suspect
    the Wine hang is related to access to the main thread (duh) but
    what is being accessed is a little more difficult to understand.
  
2014-01-22
    Seba reported the windows/gtk2 b1 did hang on him once. sigh.
       
    Setup a rakefile linux:setup:msw32 (native Gui) - it makes sense in
    some circular back to failed future way. On the plus side I can
done: get rid of the crossmingw file and the make/xmingw from the previous
    failure. Updating the fail to current fail. It makes sense.  I can
    already see the problem: gthread requires pthread. Same as GTK2/3.
    A little bit of grunt work and it links. AND it has the same deadlock
    in Wine. Pkg it up and try it on the Win 7 VM (it has some dll's that
    probably aren't needed - least of the problems). It does run on Win 7
    and it does have SOME bugs in common with the gtk2 version and it also 
    has it's own peculiarites. It's a bit faster. It has more huh? bugs.
    I'll upload to the website to complete the circle but It'll be easier
    for me to deal with the Gtk2 version.
    
==> Big Clue: can gthread be compiled to use whatever ruby is using???   
    I did some research on Wine threading. I need to do more research.
    See Gthread clues, compare to ruby win32/win32.c clues. 
  
2014-01-21 
done: openssl cross compile for Ruby. Looks simple. It's not. 
done: still to have build minimal curl (even if it's not really used)
done: I already had icoutils installed - it deals withs msw .ico. Who knew?
    I must have installed it for my website favicon.ico. 
    I Have a nicer icon (256x256) that should scale down. Created a
    federales.ico with 16,24,32,48,64 h/w images. Updated the icons in
    static/  It looks better in Windows 7.
--> get some help on writing Shoes-Cobbler (gem manager)
--> ffi-5.dll or ffi-6.dll is this a gtk3? 
  
2014-01-20 Ruby dependencies
    knapbuild/knapsack is described here
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rubyinstaller/knap-build/rubyinstaller/-D9vNo459RU/r81EycDOfyYJ
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rubyinstaller/knap-build/rubyinstaller/4ulo3o1bQOM/2F1f24XWWaQJ
--> Sadly wine doesn't like that exe (thread deadlock, same threads involved
    as Ruby/Gtk<n> There is no gui involved but its got to be ruby/rake 
    inside.  I should look into the Wine forums about threading issues.
--> If knap-build is off the menu that leaves mini-portile which is a little
    more infrastucture work for me than I want to get into. 
--> For some reason, patches listed on github don't work when when running
    patch by hand. So, I do them by eye. I suspect its tabs/spacing and 
    some vicious hard to delete hidden characters. What a waste of time.
    
done: gdbm compiles, links (must sudo make install and sudo make install-compat)
    That was BRUTAL. Nor do I care if a Shoeser tries them and they fail.
    dbm and gdbm: DONE ENOUGH!
done: iconv-1.14 - again, nothing I would expect Shoes folks to use. But
    Ruby finds it when building. 
done: openssl - there's a reason I saved this for last.  And once again
    the patch is related to work from the rubyinstaller folks. 
    
done: These dlls need to be copied by the rakefile into the target dir
    
  
2014-01-19 Ruby dependencies
    It finally dawned on me that the reason ruby can't find the libyaml
    and the like could be that pkg-config isn't correct for the cross
    compile. That isn't the case (but doesn't hurt)
done: ffi (ruby fiddle ext) compiles and links. Needed to manually copy
   ffi.h and ffitarget.h from {prefix}lib/libffi-3.0.9/include/ffi to
   {prefix}/include. The pc. isn't used by Ruby?
done: libyaml
    NOTE: NOTE: NOTE: Luis Lavena (of rubyinstaller) has plowed this
    ground well and left bread crumbs for me, to mix a metaphor. I'm still
    amazed that wine will run these test .exe's. 
    
    Anyway. Luis has two (related) projects, the gem mini-portfile and
    knap-build both which use "recipes" to build autoconf stuff that Ruby
    needs: https://github.com/luislavena/knapsack-recipes. This could be the 
    infrastructure that I need to maintain the shoes and ruby dependencies.
  
2014-01-18 
    Shoes builds Gtk2/Windows. it does require pthread and it hangs
    running in wine. Works in Windows and doesn't complain about themes.
    I Call that success. 
    
    There's some potential dll hell between rubyinstaller's ruby and gtk2 
    (probably gtk3 too) so it is important to compile a copy of ruby
    to use with Shoes. Since Gtk2 bundle provides some libraries (older)
    that gtk3-bundle. I should build a ruby to go with Gtk2 after building
done: jpeg, jpeg-9
done: gif  giflib-4.2.3
done: yaml, Frick! 
done: ffi  libffi-3.0.9 which creates libffi-5.0.dll. Were there any adults 
      in the version number room?
      Fails to install ffi.h in $prefix/include 
done: gdbm gdbm-1.10:
      flatfile.c:23:24: fatal error: arpa/inet.h: No such file or directory
      Oh God, the flashbacks! Make them stop!
      #include winsock.h patch  to flatfile.c 
      testgdbm.c:30:23: fatal error: sys/ioctl.h: No such file or directory
      PLEASE Make it stop!  Are these in MSYS? I remember this crap when
      installing gcc on Solaris. 
done: iconv      
done: openssl   
done: ruby 1.9.3

 
    
    If I've got two windows dists (gtk2, gtk3) then I need a better build
    infrastructure. Fortunatly, gkt2 & deps is unlikely to get any updates
    and I can hold the Ruby to 1.9.3 for federales. Might as well use it
    to learn what's needed.  Off to build the deps. 
  
2014-01-17 Gtk2 Windows
    I chose this one first for several reasons. (1) it's pretty easy
    to delete on Windows after a failure. (2) I really want to see if
    Gtk2 works on Windows (3) Windows might attract a few more testers
done: (4) it might remind me to fix some of the missing ruby libs
    
done: Make /srv/chroot/mingwgtk2. Populate with gtk2 bundle and symbolic
    links into the GTK3 dir. Tweek rakefile env.rb to make
    it work. Link to libjpeg, libyaml. 
--> compile the gtheme schema.dtd? 
--> Note the README for the gtk2 bundle about themes. I should read the
    gtk3 README too, me thinks.
done: redo the pgk-config fixer-upper sed script
done: Soft links to include for jpeg.h and friends. 
done: Add -lfontconfig to make_so [LDFLAGS] if gkt2
done: We have a link of shoes.exe ! and a link failure of ftsearch - I wonder
    if my extconf hack fails somehow? ya think? Yes and easily fixed. 
==> Do better with extconf.rb like Luis suggests. Kind of low priority.
done: Just a matter of copying the dlls for Gtk2.  Wine is good at reporting
    missing dlls.
    intl8 was intl.dll in gtk2
    pixman was gdk-pixbuf
    libxml2 was libexpat-1.dll
    
  
2014-01-16 Cleanup before packaging experiments

done Rakefile: task 'install' is only for source builds and task 'package'
   is only for cross compiled builds. Might screw up MinGW on MinGW 
   or OSX on OSX, but no one is doing those. 
   
--> Try fpm with i386/Gtk2 and debian VM.
--> Try fpm with x86_64/Gtk2 and Suse VM
--> Try again to distribute Gkt2.so's in a Linux binary.
      if require dependencies with fpm doesn't work.
      Suse, Fedora, Debian.
--> Do a Gtk2 Windows installer.

done: got rid of VERSION.txt
  
2014-01-15  Git and version numbers research
    VERSION.txt file is incorrect in soo many ways. 
    I developed a hard on about getting rid of VERSION.txt. It just
    seems to clutter things up and its only used when processing the
    command line '-v'  (MacOs doesn't even ask shoes to do that - it
    uses Version.txt in a shell script to handle -v. 
Done: New constant Shoes::RELEASE_BUILD_DATE (a string YYYYMMDD)
Done: Modify shoes.rb to use the constants instead of VERSION.txt
Done: Remove VERSION.txt rule from Rakefile.


    
--> While researching VERSION I came across this jewel (shoes.rb:447)
    if RUBY_VERSION =~ /^1\.9/ and !@shy . So much lurking cruft. 
    1.9.1 is also in cache.rb, rakefiles and god nows what else.
    

2014-01-14 Get Tight Shoes (aka source build) correct.

    Remember when I said Gtk2 would confuse things. I've changed my mind.
    I think a working Shoes (Gtk2) is more important than proof of concept
    See Packaging.txt

Done: Wasted two days chasing the wrong problem.
    The ruby I copy is hard coded to look in ~/.rvm for rbconfig
    not the one I copied. 
    
Done: shoes/lib/chipmunk.rb - require 'chimpmunk.so' works for Loose Shoes
    
    
Done:  Set jailbreak location to HOME/.shoes/federales (same as user install)
    
--> Running info-startup.rb in x86_64 in it's schroot runs into some
    theme issues (I think). Runs fine if not in the schroot.
  
2014-01-13 Loose Shoes (source build)

kindof: require 'chipmunk.so' works but require 'chipmunk' doesn't. 
    Some sort of namespace issue based on load path? 
    
    Rethink Loose Shoes some more. Can't depend on it being load-relative.
    so we have to copy it and rewrite rbconfig.rb in the copy. 
    Plan A (I have a lot of plan A's)
done (1)Move make/linux/* to make/linux/loose for safe keeping. Copy
    make/x86../files to make/linux and tweek (rewrite and fail)
    (2) in pre_build we copy the EXT_RUBY and then we link against it.
Yes   have I mentioned how much I hate these rakefiles? 
fixed  Does not run chipmunk yet. 
-->  Theme weirdness Max h and w for info-startup.rb in gtk3 but 
     not in gtk2
    (3) add a step to rewrite the (copyied) ruby's rbconfig so it points
      to where we are building (~/....dist/). DESTDIR or TOPDIR ?

  
2014-01-12

done: use a Federales Icon for platform/msw/shoes.ico when I get bored. Also 
--> figure out how to tame down the nsis progress messages. Damn wordy, that
   
done: Get those missing Ruby ext/libs working on the MinGw cross compile.
    or use the rubyinstaller's libs since ruby on windows doesn't 
    respect --enable-load-relative nor am I likely to get 
    --enable-pthread in place of win-threads. 

done: Do a simple packaging for Linux. fpm? Nope - makeself

done: Do a Gtk-2 binary package for Linux? No. It only confuses things.  Same
   thoughts for a Gtk2-Windows. Fun (perhaps), interesting but lets put
   that in the Plan B file.
   
done: Need to think about the "Loose Shoes" native/source linux build.
    (1) compile and move the exts into the ~/rvm tree? Don't like. Shoes
       shouldn't screw with installed rubys. It's a hack (that would work)
    (2) copy the libs out of rvm into shoes and hope the duplication 
       doesn't trigger error messages. I kind of think I did that before.
done: Chipmunk fails. 
done: The static lib might be the wrong thing to do. It's ok.
done: Don't allow a binary package (tight shoes) to be packaged from Loose
    shoes (ie needs crosscompile file to package)

DONE: Figure out the GSettings for Windows. 
   ccoupe@bronco:/srv/chroot/mingw32$ wine bin/glib-compile-schemas.exe \
   share/glib-2.0/schemas/
   ccoupe@bronco:/srv/chroot/mingw32/share/glib-2.0/schemas$ ls -l gschemas.compiled*
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ccoupe ccoupe 1317 Jan 12 20:35 gschemas.compiled
-rw-r--r-- 1 ccoupe ccoupe 1317 Sep 21 13:55 gschemas.compiled.sav
   That needs to be copied to share/glib-2.0/schemas in the package tree
   and then all the dialogs work. Very Good.
   
Done: While I am at it, figure out why Windows shows the generic icon in its
   menus. Pretty sure I left something out in the rake file.  I did.
   Works as expected on Windows 7. Uploaded to shoes-3.2a1.exe because
   it's equivalent to a1 on Linux - same errors and ommissions. 

2014-01-11
   Whoa! On a whim I copied the Windows Shoes directory to my Win 7 VM
   It Works - sort of. If I select open an app, it complains that there
   are no GSettings installed. True. It then croaks gracefully. I could
   browse the manual and bring up the console. Left alone the slash screen
   eventually gets a 'not repsonding' message.  Good news, bad news. 
   Good: Gtk3 mostly works on Shoes/Windows. The Wine deadlock is partially
   a wine issue. Bad news - the bugs above. I'm not ruling out thread
   problems under windows either. 
   
done: Restore the init seq back to ruby first, then gtk. See if thats better
   or worse in Windows. 
   Much Better. No crashs or hangs. samples from within the manual work
   except for the known gkt3 errors until you try dialogs/color which
   dies from the GSettings not installed problem.
   
done: Figure out the GSetting stuff.

done: Do the packaging thing. 
    For some reason, it puts the Shoes Manual Icon/short cut in programs
    and you have to wait for the all programs to pop up to select shoes.
    This is probably something to do with nsis choices.
    
done: Do Gtk2 for Windows? 

   Figure out the winedbg. Won't help debug threading though.
   
half done: world.c -- don't do the sysinit(0,0) it's already been called
   Now I have a thread blocking problem. Looks like the same problem
   that stumped me two years ago using native windows gui.
err:ntdll:RtlpWaitForCriticalSection section 0x116838 "?" wait timed out in thread 0009, blocked by 0000, retrying (60 sec)
err:ntdll:RtlpWaitForCriticalSection section 0x116838 "?" wait timed out in thread 0009, blocked by 0000, retrying (60 sec)
^C
(shoes.exe:8): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_main_quit: assertion `main_loops != NULL' failed

--> VERY IMPORTANT CLUE:  Gtk caught the ^C. So Gdk/Glib is running
  (or trying to). I think Gtk needs to start it's threading before ruby
  does it's threads. The doc is clear about Gtk and the main thread.  
  Shouldn't be a problem to init the gui(s) earlier (he says) except for 
  the legacy --ruby <args> processing. AFIK, thats to handle Shoes.setup
  which I don't need. Who wants to bet there is a Ruby.thread(shell shoes?)
  that will burn my ass later. 
--> That didn't help. still hangs as above.  Some instrumenting printfs
   and it's hanging in   v = (VALUE)ruby_options(3, argv);, called from
   shoes_ruby_embed. 


2014-01-10
   After looking at ruby code win32/win32.c I can see that I'm 
   not going to convert that to pthreads.  It's also very clear
   that code needs to be initialized the way Shoes/windows does and
   not the simple gtk way (in fact, both are needed).
   
   May run afoul of threading problems. See note about deprecated:
   https://developer.gnome.org/gdk3/stable/gdk3-Threads.html
   
--> Why does bin/main.skel get copied to bin/main.c for every rake?
   to rewrite %defaults% - who uses that? Hackety? 

done I'm getting a Wine graphical "page fault" display. That's kind of
   good. 
   WinMain bin/main.c:88 ->
   shoes_init world.c:117 ->
   shoes_ruby_embed world.c:98 ->
   ruby_sysinit ruby.c:1872 ->
   rb_w32_sysinit win32/win32.c:680 ->
   rb_w32_cmdvector win32/win32.c:1638  ptr to zero. 
   
Done: Note that rb_w32_cmdvector can be called twice from
   gtk.c I suspect the windows startup is buggy. Ya think? Time to see
   what works (in the ruby code, it's got to do the start up for ruby.exe)
   or maybe dig up some working shoes code from long ago. Perhaps my
   changes with #ifndef RUBY_1_8 was incorrect for windows (ya think?)
   
   
   
2014-01-09
   I get a seg fault running shoes.exe in wine:
   <internal:gem_prelude>:1: [BUG] Segmentation fault
--> gdb is not setup to work properly with wine loaded code.
   
-->I'm re-learning more than I want about mkmf.rb. HACKED it so it
   works just well enough to compile and link. I'm not proud.
   Really need to use the TGT's rbconfig in extconf and my rakefiles.
   
done: Ruby/Mingw doesn't --enable-load-relative . Might not matter 
   on Windows, but what do I know? [Update: It works, so who cares]
    
--> Ruby/MingW DOES NOT use pthread. This is a problem because Gtk does.
    Could be a problem. Likely. I wonder if newer rubys address this on
    Windows? 

   

2014-01-08 MinGW
    Curl vs http/win*.c. We don't use curl or pthreads. Need to do
    Changed some timer defs in gtk.c & config.h, Many #if were added.
    
--> How much of the Windows init/close stuff has to be done 
    for a Gtk3 Windows app? In gtk.c:101 is
    int shoes_throw_message(unsigned int name, VALUE obj, void *data)
    It's only called by image.c. Convert to gdk_idle? and not deal
    with pthreads.
DONE: Need to populate the lib/ruby/ dir
DONE: Copy the deps -- see Gtk.org list
DONE: GTK3 requires pthreads - can I build ruby to match?
    in theory, yes --enable-pthread in cjc-ruby-cfg.sh. 
    Which means I should be able to use pthread.h and friends in gtk.c
    which means I could use curl instead of shoes/http/win*.c  and
    undo many changes I made to gtk.c
DONE: Build ext's. Ickk! ldflags, LIBS are wrong in generated Makefile.
DONE Resources, icons and what not
DONE NSIS app packager. 
--> If it works, then I need to do much tighter integration with Gkt3 
    and windows/glib.
  
2014-01-07 MinGW
    So Gtk3 works well enough. 
    Rake-compiler? - no joy same problems as my cross compile.
done: I'm going to ignore the missing Ruby ext/s for now.
DONE: Build minimal curl. Really should handle gnutls and openssl.
    Did I remember shoes/windows doesn't use curl. No, I didn't remember.
Fixed:  can't find -lc ?? -- always use --host and --build when cross
    compiling.
    Modify the xmingw32 rake files.
      where is ruby-1.9.pc? It's not created by ruby/mingw cross compile?
      I edited the one from Windows and it's likely to be wrong for linking
done: Copied libyaml.dll from the Rubyinstaller. Need to build my own.
    Modified config.h to not include gdk/gdkx if Windows. Added 
     -DSHOES_GTK_WIN32 to env.rb and an #ifndef to config.h
Done: Dies in image.c looking for gif_lib.h
-->  Does any shoes-er use gif? We should scrap it. If someone did the
     hard work in image.c. Put this on the futures list. For now, I'll 
     cross compile libgif. Grrr. Complains about missing xmlto tool. 
     Make install works and the compile continues.
Done Dies in world.c. Now it gets challenging mixing GTK and Windows
     Expect issues with app.c and kin.
     Hack Alert! search for SHOES_GTK_WIN32. Don't use SIGQUIT in
     world.c.  Expect to undo and redo this several times. It compiles.
Done  Dies linking libshoes.so. I predicted that, earlier.  Link 
     libshoes with -lmsvcrt-ruby191.
     Dies linking because gtk.c wants pthreads.  
-->  I should add all the cjc-xxx-cfg.sh scripts to git.
Done: Recompile one of linux variants to make sure I didn't break anything 
     with the mingw changes. 

2014-01-06 MinGW 
    Plan A is to not use a (s)chroot for dependencies.  I may use
    rake-compiler to build ruby. Or not. 
    
    I also plan to use Gtk3/Windows instead of _why's windows code. (or
    gkt2 or both). That will make for a larger download but the benefits
    are large (when it works).  Might even convince the OSX folks to try
    compiling Shoes3.2 with Gtk3/osx. 
    
    A cross compiled Gtk3(windows-32bit) test program works on Win7(64) VM
    AND with wine. See CrossCompiling.txt. I know a cross compiled Ruby
    can be made to work and curl is an speed bump but the dream of 
    cross compiling Shoes for Windows (with gtk3) seems very achievable. 
    
 
  
2014-01-05  MinGW, Github
DONE: Before I go crazy on the MinGW stuff, I should 'get right' with git.
    Moved a bunch of stuff around and generated a massive commit. As far
    as I care, github is current. I promise to commit more often. 

2014-01-04  MinGW
    Fired up the Win7/64 VM and install Msys/MinGE, RubyInstaller (32)
    Then copy c:\msys c:\Ruby193 to a shared folder. Import that to
    /srv/chroot/mingw32 (not a chroot though)
    
DONE: Install or build latest version of Wine. Ubuntu is pretty far
    behind - 1.4. Will have to configure Wine properly. I expect some
    trouble. Installed 1.6 via ppa update.  
    I got Adobe Digital Editions installed in wine. 
    
DONE: Sadly, rubyinstaller built Ruby w/o the load-relative that shoes
    needs. I'll attempt to cross compile it. Ruby/Windows has it own
    ext/dl code so it may cross compile where it wouldn't on the pi.
    
--> It does cross compile but I need some dep libs/headers/defs
    See CrossCompiling.txt
    
 
2013-12-31 Cross Compile (pi)
    Hacked away at extconf.rb for chipmunk and ftsearch extentions so
    they are built with the cross compiler and linker and the proper
DONE: Ruby includes. The mods are kind of brute force. I'll make
    them elegant in the future, ya sure.
    
DONE: Backport those changes in env.rb, task.rb
DONE: i386 - because this is build in chroot, only the TGT_RUBY_ARCH 
    matters.
DONE: x86_64 
DONE dist 
    chipmunk fails for other reasons. But the ext compile is good.
Done: Do a simple packaging. cd to pkg/. mkdir shoes3.2a1-{arch}. 
    cp ../{arch}/* shoes3.2a1-{arch}. Tar and zip. sftp to the website.
    
--> This should be automated even if it's alpha. 
 
2013-12-30 Cross Compile (pi)
    I can give up and require a ruby that's been compiled on the target
    (with --load-relative) OR
    Dig into that ext/dl/mkmf.log before declaring failure. The mkmf.log
    is pretty clear:
Using 'dlopen' in statically linked applications requires at runtime the
shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking
/srv/chroot/debrpi/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libdl.a(dlopen.o): In function `d
lopen':
(.text+0xc): undefined reference to `__dlopen'
    There is a libdl.so next to libdl.a, it's link to 
    /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libdl.so.2 which has no symbols? uses
    $ ldd libdl-2.13.so 
	    libc.so.6 => /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc.so.6 (0xf6694000)
	    /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 (0xf6fd9000)
    That link can only work if you are inside the chroot. 
    
    One solution would be to get the x86_64/arm cross compiler and the ruby source
    tree inside the chroot (/opt/src/ruby). That would require some qemu
    magic to emulate both. Might be possible? 
    
    Or, do the ruby compile using the emulated gcc-4.6.3. 
    I t ' s  s l o w ,  r e a l l y   s l o w . But it's working. 
    It's quite a test of qemu. I'm impressed.
    For giggles and future fun, the arch ruby chose is 'armv7l-linux-eabi'
    I have NO IDEA where that triplet came from.
Fixed: Shoes/pi works with that ruby. I suspect curl opts would croak
    things. 
    
    A crude hack, would be to use a hard link or just copy the ultimate 
    libdl.so where the cross compiling stuff wants it. I'm not going to
    do that because it's really easy to bork your system if you make a
    mistake.
    
    A simpler hack would be to comment out the lines in ext/dl/extconf.rb
    that look for the functions. It compiles. Will it run shoes? No
    does the hack fail - yes, in serveral ways
    
==> Curl - just apt-get install the damn thing in the schroot. Copy the
    least heavy weight libcurl.so to Shoes.
    

==> Chipmunk.so is a X86_64 ELF. Could explain some problems if the ext
   aren't compiled with the correct compiler. Fixing it is an adventure. 
   
  
2013-12-29 (pi cross compile)
    You'd think I'd see this sooner. Add -I/usr/include (or your-chroot
    equivalent) early in the gcc flags.  Compiles and links but
    still has a couple of warnings that aren't right. 
--> curl related: complaints from bits/socket.h
--> infinity, nan redef - ruby related. 
    But, it works! - it's slow to get started and it's gtk3 so there 
    are known bugs. But the cross compile effort is OK. 
--> Try using the cross compiled ruby instead of the rvm ruby:
    Same compiler warnings.
    Shoes.tar is 7MB smaller - I wonder what is missing ? - Lots of doc,
    bundler and rvm stuff. 
    
    It dies in ruby init-prelude - can't load rubygems.rb.
==> ext/dl missing on pi, for certain. It might well explain require
    failures. What does my raspbian choot need that a real raspbian have?
    In the ruby src code, ext/dl/mkmf.log has the clues. It found dlfcn.h
    and -ldl is ok, but dlopen() is missing when building/running a test.
    Do I suspect --sysroot ? Is the Pope Catholic? 
    
Fixed: chipmunk.so is missing but there is a 'x86_64-linux' file on the pi
    see line line 87 (or so) in tasks.env. Damn rakefiles, Bad Cecil! It
    works for i386 and x86_64 because they run chroot and report as 
    expected.  
    
   
    I discovered where the shoes.desktop file should go on the Pi. 
    See that dir named 'Desktop'? it has all the users launchers.
  
2013-12-28 (pi cross compile)
    This could have saved me a week or two of foolishness. Gcc has
    a --sysroot=<dir> flag in newer compilers. gcc-4.8 for sure and I think
    gcc-4.7 and net wisdom says maybe in 4.6. Major score for cross compiling.
DONE: Fixes the jconfig.h issue. 
    
DONE: Compiling ruby gets much more interesting. It Can't find -lcrypto 
    when linking digest/md5.so because you have to use it on both CFLAGS
    and LDFLAGS. It compiled socket w/o complaining, pysch, openssl, etc.
    This the first cross compiled ruby that includes everything normal 
    and that I feel confident about.
    
    --sysroot is a Big Deal if I ever get to the mingw cross compile. 
    
FIXED: Different include file errors using --sysroot compiling shoes but 
    that's OK - it was a mess before and it is less messy now.
    
--> because the pi compile uses the Ubuntu x86_64 pkg-config, if that
    gets screwed up by something apt-get (ie me) it can confuse 
    pkg-config <long-path-to.pc> to not work. Nasty hidden gotcha.
    Yet another reason to not trust it.

2013-12-27  (pi cross compile)
==> The features.h/stdc-predef.h errors are back  because the compiler
    is gcc-4.8.  This time I found a solution and I understand why it 
    should work https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/RaspberryPi
    That doesn't fix all problems. seems that the raspian includes and
    libs uses names like 'arm-linux-gnueabihf' and the new compiler uses
    'arm-linux-gnueabi'
    
    Generate a new compile with 'hf' on the end. Doesn't help when 
    cross compiling ruby dies in file.c:2276 which is bracketed with
    various #ifdef EVIL TIME CONSTANTS.  I know that hell but I'm tired 
    of gcc issues, although I learned a lot.
    
    Time for plan B. The Qemu emulator in the chroot works well enough
    to  'apt-get install libreadline6-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev' and then
    'apt-get install ruby1.9.3' Time to find the rbconfig.rb and see how
    it was built. It's at {CHROOT}/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/arm-linux-eabihf/rbconfig.rb
    Sadly it doesn't appear that was built 'load-relative' and Shoes needs
    that (Tight Shoes). 
    
    I also have the pi's rvm built 1.9.3 and 
    is load relative. It's also 'armv6l-linux-eabi' so it might not
    use hardfp or it might. It may also conflict with character set in ways
    I don't want to consider. I'll use the rvm until I can my cross compiler
    sorted out. 
Done: Cross Compile a minimal libcurl.so
Fixed For some reason, the .pc files in chroot are not indexed together
    
Fixed jconfig.h in /usr/include/arm...eabihf/ in chroot and pi.
    Add with that -I include I get the <bits/predefs> bug so it's
    related to the features.h (which I copied from x-tools/sysroot)
Done: Does the jpeg8 install put that in the compilers sysroot? instead
    of the os directories? That would explain a lot. Something like that.
    
    Do I have a Plan C? (yes, I do) Get the tool chain that worked best
    http://elinux.org/RPi_Kernel_Compilation - moved parts of the download
    to ~/x-tools . Undo the {chroot}/usr/include/feature.h hack. 
Fixed: Works better until it gets to jconfig.h.
    

2013-12-26
   Created a schroot for the raspberry (debrpi) and did the debootstrap
   thing for raspian. And the debian deps that shoes wants.
   Installed the qemu-static in the chroot /usr/bin - it works well enough
   to run many things (slowly) but n
   
   I really want a x86_64 crosscompiler to armv6-.... and after much
   futzing I have one in /home/ccoupe/x-tools . That's not the ideal
   spot, but good enough for now. Don't fight the defaults. 
Done: Add it to the regular path.  It will not run in the chroot. 
Done: Clean up a bunch of other compilers that almost worked. Screw up
    and rebuild ct-ng and compiler. 
    
   
   i386 and x86_64 cross compiles work well enough (for Shoes-Gtk3)
  
2013-12-25
   Installing Suse/XFCE-64bit in a VM. Easier to deal with than Fedora.
     libgif.so.4 missing from the Shoes pkg. And the libcurl-gnutls.so.4
     vbox permissions on the shared folders.  Mostly a Oracle
     problem not Suse,Fedora or Debian.
     
   Setup an debian/64 schroot. Compile ruby and curl in there.
   Build shoes in there.
   Verify that it works on Ubuntu-64 -Yes
   Test on Suse
    missing libpcre.so.3 
   /home/ccoupe/x86_64-linux/shoes-bin: symbol lookup error: 
   /usr/lib64/libgobject-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_unix_fd_source_funcs
      Why didn't it use the libgobject the came with shoes?
      I suspect a lib version number issues but I'm giving up for now
      
   Test on Fedora
   /home/ccoupe/x86_64-linux/shoes-bin: symbol lookup error: 
   /lib64/libgobject-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_unix_fd_source_funcs
   Hmmm. same error message but slightly different from Suse.
   After I removed libgobject from the shoes dir, it still has the error.
   
    redo the i386 curl, ruby build after getting rid of libcurl-gnutls
    and git pkgs. Works fine in the chroot and on the debian VM.
==? i386 Fails to run on Ubuntu-64 bit - cascade of missing libs...
    not sure I care that much but it did work once. 

    Retry the x86_64 on ubuntu. Works fine in the chroot.
Done: Fails when run outside chroot. Guess what the error is. Go Ahead
    /home/ccoupe/Projects/shoes3.2/x86_64-linux/shoes-bin: symbol lookup error:
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgobject-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_unix_fd_source_funcs
    That turned out be a name issue with the copied libgobject
    Now complaining the libffi.so.5 is missing. Who call for that? Fixed
==> /home/ccoupe/Projects/shoes3.2/x86_64-linux/shoes-bin: symbol lookup error:
   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gio/modules/libdconfsettings.so: undefined symbol: g_mapped_file_get_bytes
   Could this be related to the curl config -disable version symbols ? Nope.
   
==> Don't copy all the Gtk2/Glib stuff - then x86_64 works both in the 
    Debian chroot and outside it in Ubuntu. Clearly I'm missing some
    critical knowledge. If gkt2 is on the target system (this case), don't 
    include my own libaries. It can break multi-arch/lib handling and really
    there's no good way to know from here where any of the libs are kept in
    Suse, Fedora, Ubuntu and more.  Give up on Gtk2.
    
==> Shoes binaries might be slightly easier for Gkt3 through.
    Install gtk+-3.0-dev in chroots deb386 and debx86 and try again
    Yikes - a lot gets dragged into the chroot for gtk+-3.0-dev (libssl,
    libcurl-gnutls)
    Don't recompile curl yet but don't be surprised when it pop up again.
    Status: 
YES 1. From inside deb386 chroot
==> 2. From outside deb386 chroot on Ubuntu 64 
    I have broken apt-get pkgs:i386. sigh.
YES 3. From Debian 7.2 32bit VM
YES 4. From inside debx86 chroot 
YES 5. From outside debx86 chroot (ubuntu 64)
YES!6. from Suse 64 bit
YES!7. from Fedora 64 bot


   

2013-12-24

Done:  Tight Shoes 386 works fine in the shcroot.
   
Done:  Loose Shoes 386 (gtk2) works on Deb 7.2/386 that doesn't have
   gtk2 installed. 
   
Done: Need the X86_64 equivalent. I can't really test it w/o a 64 VM
    and if I was going to do that, I'd pick something non-debian. 
    This was too easy. I only needed to fix the env.rb where libungif was.

Next:
    Fedora 20/X86_64 does'n want to run in OracleBox. Because some idiot
    at the keyboard didn't select that in the install. Try again.
    Working much better. Yikes - its been infected by that damn Unity
    interface. After much futzing getting guest additions installed in 
    Fedora, and root copy from /media/sf_cross because groups is wrong
    for vbox:
$ ./x86_64-linux/shoes
/home/ccoupe/x86_64-linux/shoes-bin: error while loading shared libraries: 
libcurl-gnutls.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    and
$ ./i386-gnu-linux/shoes
./i386-gnu-linux/shoes: /home/ccoupe/i386-gnu-linux/shoes-bin: 
/lib/ld-linux.so.2: bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory
   So it doesn't have i386 multiarch out of the box. Clearly there is
   some hidden versioning going on with curl - try a rename.
==> mv libcurl.so.4 libcurl-gnutls.so.4 - works but can't find
==> libpcre.so.3  - copy it from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3
==> librtmp.so.0  - copy from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librtmp.so.0
==> libssl.so.1.0.0 - anybody see the pattern ? Curl? Don't use the one 
   in the build system. /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.0.0
   it will be faster and easier to build a new curl. No - it isn't.
==> Really should chroot a x86_64 linux and build curl and ruby using
   its headers and libraries.
   
    
Next:
    Suse 13.1 netinstall did notice it wasn't running in a 64 bit system and 
    put up a warning screen. Good for Suse. Install with XFCE because
    ah, why not? I need to figure out the menu options for shoes. 
    
    Try the X86_64 and i386 versions of Shoes on Suse/64
    Figure out how to chroot Suse and if Shoes doesn't run.
    mount -o loop ~/Desktop/openSUSE-13.1-NET-x86_64.iso /mnt/cdrom
    cd into mnt/cdrom/boot. Several squashfs files in there.
    Hung during downloading of components
    
Next:  Raspbian version. That one is a little trickier to setup the
    chroot and the rakefiles properly since the compiler (and ruby/rake)
    have to run outside the chroot. 
    
Done: Someone ought to tell gcc to stop complaining when compiling 
   chipmunk. Add -Wno-declaration-after-statement to xextconf.rb
   Helps a lot with clutter.
    
2013-12-23
   The schroot approach is working well.  I compiled ruby in the chroot
   using the chroot's gcc-4.7/386 compiler. Compiled and ran shoes (loose)
   
   I want to build Shoes from a normal environment.
FIXED: {chroot}gcc doesn't like be invoked from outside the {chroot}
   Build a compiler that can be (crosstools-NG) OR build shoes inside
   schroot. Today, I'm going to do the schroot way because I'm more
   interested in building tight shoes (gtk2/386) and updating the
   rakefiles to build a shoes that runs (i386) on both the host system
   and the debian VM.
   
done: Copy the rest of the deps - not very elegant code in env.rb
   
==> setup a cron job to do a schroot apt-get update once a week. download
   and install the latest updates. both i386 and raspbian. 
  
2013-12-22
   I have found a well known issue with gcc-4.8 vs 4.7 that explains
   the  STDC_ISO and other failures when building the 32 bit Shoes.
   I could downgrade to 4.7 on my Ubuntu 13.10 64 bit system, or I could
   set up a chroot (and possibly build the compiler) or poke around with
   existing mulitlib/multiarch and hacks. I've been fighting with the
   Shoes rakefiles and I'm tired of mindless hacks.
   
   Long term, dealing with chroot might be better. See CrossCompiling.txt
   
2013-12-21 - i686 cross compile
    Copied some more headers and libs from Debian VM after install gtk3-dev 
    and other deps on it. 
    
    Moved the dep lib copies from pre_build to copy_deps_to_dir. Since
    I haven't fixed the -L link flags, here's the list of deps
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgtk-3
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgdk-3
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -latk-1.0
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgio-2.0
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpangocairo-1.0
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcairo-gobject
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpango-1.0
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcairo
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgobject-2.0
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lglib-2.0
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lungif
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcairo
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpango-1.0
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgobject-2.0
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lglib-2.0
     Add ruby and curl to that list (and a couple more for windows)
     
     Im getting that #define __STDC_ISO_10646__ warning. What did I do
     to correct that before. Rebuild ruby? Didn't fix it.  I think
     it's an include file - somehow /usr/include/stdc-predef.c is being
     used. See http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/porting_to.html. gcc 4.8.1 is 
     used for the cross compiler and Debian Wheezy is 4.7.x . This problem
     went away when I switched pi cross compilers. Add -ffreestanding to
     LINUX_CFLAGS. And recompile ruby. And fails differently but still
     dragging from /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu instead of where I say.
     Hangover from the Multi-arch ? 
   



2013-12-20
    Of course some of those i386 libraries were reinstalled by software
    update. So far, no harm.
    
done: Copy the /lib /usr/lib /usr/include from the Debian i386 VM. 
    Sigh. The drive/shared folder is mapped strangely. Claims to be ro
    when creating softlinks. I have to manually create the soft links
    so "ln -s libjpeg.so.8.4.0 libjpeg.so.8". Shoes only cares about the 
    major number.  No doubt this will be an issue. 
    
FIXED i386: Need Curl, cross compiled from source for i386, no ssl version. 
    We don't need gopher, imap, pop. smtp, telnet. Keep TFTP for 
    the embedded folks although I don't think shoes can use it. PITA.
    
done:  Cross compile Cairo, Pango. Sigh. It has to be done. Good practice
    for Mingw32
    
2013-12-19
FIXED: It is possible to get worse. Installing curl:i386 screws up the
    compile for x86_64 (dist and the crossbuild version). Thank you
    curl and multiarch Ubuntu. Removed with synaptic. Reinstall the 64 bit.
    
FIXED: linking dist/shoes.a "-lungif" not found. What is with this ungif crap
    I can see the lib, right next to libjpeg.  I removed the :i386 version
    of libgif and reinstalled libgif-dev.  Boo multiarch. Bad Unbuntu.
    
FIXED:  I think I'll remove multi-arch from ubuntu (64) - I have to build the
    deps for cross compiles (pi, mingw) anyway. What's another arch? 
    ungif/gif, curl, ruby, glib, gobject.. what could go wrong?
    OR I could configure multiarch better. What a dreamer I can be.
    There is still buttload of /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu files after removal
    I'm going to ignore them. Maybe ubuntu needs them. 
    
    
==> Here is the Shoes Mentality. I decided to write a dependancy manager in
    Shoes so the rake files will just grab the <arch>.yaml created by this
    brain fart and the rake files would be less ugly and more elegant. 
    Why? Because its fun. And it might work and I really don't want to fix
    the GTK3 code. I'd rather be scripting in style than find the root problem.
    Its DepManager.rb and it is brilliant, although 95% unfinished. You 
    can't abstract your way out broken reality. 
    
2013-12-18
    Taking a break from the pi cross compile suckage.
    Gtk3 hint from the web" The docs for
      # gdk_window_begin_paint_region give more details on how this
      # works.
    i386:libglib:  Look at what Calibre does (/usr/local/lib/calibre)
      it includes all the shared libraries of Qt and more in it
      There is the copy_deps_to_dist task for this. Just need a list of
fixed: If it works glib-2.0, will have to do this for X86_64 and xarmv6-pi
      Still Fails - its curl.so.4 that is linked to glibc-2.so.specific.version
      Curl! Damn thee Curl! Down Curl! Down! Bad Curl!
      
==> What would a "system" install of shoes look like
     /usr/local/bin/shoes -- the shell script pointing to --->
     /usr/local/lib/shoes -- everything else in dist/
     
==> Thinking about the deps. I hate that the rake files load the pkg-config
    -- it never changes and if its wrong, I have to unfix it somehow. 
    Danger! Danger! Will Robertson! I'm about to re-invent dep handling
    before fixing that curl problem. See Deps.txt
     
2013-12-17
    Totally frustrated with linking Shoes for the pi.
    I suspect the curl config is not helping. 
    
2013-12-16
FIXED    Libgif.so.4 has the code. Need a soft link from libungif.so.4 to it.
==>  Sigh, I wish I'd switched to cmake instead of whacking on the rake files
FIXED!!! i386 version loads and runs on 64bit multiarch. A couple of Gtk theme
    warnings but thats gtk-2/386 running under Gtk3/X86_64 shell.  
    No warnings or whines from ruby. 
    
    YES it was a "DUH!" moment. I was passing -shared to the link of shoes-bin
    you only do that for the link of libshoes. DUH!
    
==> On Debian 7.1 wheezy
    ccoupe@elvis:~$ ./i386-gnu-linux/shoes
    /home/ccoupe/i386-gnu-linux/shoes-bin: /lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/cmov/libc.so.6: 
    version `GLIBC_2.15' not found (required by /home/ccoupe/i386-gnu-linux/libcurl.so.4)
    
    I could have many missing dependencies.  Wheezy does have

fixed:  Hmm. That should work.

fixed: arm pi link of shoes (main.o) is failing - can't find lungif.
    
    
2013-12-15
    same seg fault when the i386 (Loose) runs on Debian 7 VM
    Something is wrong with the linked main (shoes-bin)
 
2013-12-14
    Loose shoes builds on raspberry (if you don't compile bloops since
    I don't have portaudio on the pi or care to). Runs OK. 
    
    Tight Shoes (cross compile) for pi finally builds. Dies with a 
    seg fault before it gets to main(). Built with rvm ruby.
done: Curl sys/socket  warnings on compile
done: Trying cross compiled ruby (no openssl, readline, pysch)
    Still with the bit/socket.h warning from curl
    math.h warning about redef of INFINITY and NAN
done: I'm using the headers for the PI, should I use those headers for
    the cross compiler? Which did ruby use? 
    
done: Many issues with getting Ubuntu 13.10 set up with multi-arch libraries
    See CrossCompiling.txt. Don't trust pkg-config.
    Compiles and links now.
    
done: i386-linux-gnu/shoes fails. Seg faults (0x1). JUST LIKE THE armv6-pi
    cross compiled version of Shoes does. Suggests a common fault might 
    exist in the linking. Do you think? I bet its a face palm discovery.
    
  
2013-12-13 arvm6 building
done: Lot of issues building the arvmv6 ruby. No Sockets or openssl !!
    Need to use the pi include files and rebuild?
    New compiler is slighthly better but still don't have openssl,
    pysch, readline. Do have socket with --enable-wide-getaddrinfo
FIXED Removed Ubuntu's arm compiler toolchain. Used this one
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19162072/installing-raspberry-pi-cross-compiler
    That fixed the warnings about character sets. 
FIXED: Should test compiling shoes on the pi (default loose shoes, rvm ruby)
done: Still using the rvm rbconfig, there are some warnings curl related.
    for the cross compile. no curl warnings for native build.


2013-12-12
   The default build, (Loose Shoes) Works. Mostly.
FIXED Modify make/linux to use the standard ruby layout. Copy shoes
    extensions to shoes dirs. Set up a gem loading path for those exts
    in cache.rb
==> Hardcoded 1.9.1 in cache.rb
==> $ dist/shoes -g env
    undefined method `source_index' for Gem:Module
==> simple-chipmunk fails on require chipmunk so ext's are not correct

done: Setup rakefiles for i686-gnu-linux cross compile
done: Build 32 bit Ruby (i386-gnu-linux). Works, w/o readline.
    Might need more configuring. 
done: Get the env.rb more correct (see the armv6 env.rb) 
done: Need 32 bit pkg-config, hdrs, libs for cairo, pango, gobject, glib


apt-file -a i386 search libXXX.so

2013-12-11
FIXED:  Rewrote the rakefile for x86_64-linux to copy the normal ruby directory
  structure for Shoes. Now ruby finds rubygems when it inits and thats
  more important for future compatibility with 2.0 and 2.1. It looks like
  {dist}/
        libruby.so
        libshoes.so
        {deps}.so 
        shoes (script that runs shoes-bin)
        shoes-bin (linked main.c)
        /samples/
        /fonts/   Move these three to lib/? 
        /static/
        /lib/
            shoes.rb

                site_ruby/
                vendor_ruby/
            
Fixed: world.c:shoes_start() to mangle the $: path appropriately
   For apps/scripts not run under the shoes tree, we still need the '.'
Fixed: Dies on ftsearch (from shoes.rb:150)
   rakefile - compile and copy ftsearch ext
done: clean up cache.rb hacks, debugging..
done: Expect issues with font, image loading? 
done: Apply the lessons to building dist (default).


 Open
  Loose Shoes Ubuntu
    once Shoes causes ruby to load from dist/lib (first 'require' ?)
    then the odds for getting a second loadpath for gems code is high.
    Everything should work OK, but the console messages are annoying,
    particularly with gems like fpm.
    
    it would be nice not to copy/pkg all the duplicate Ruby code in dist/
    
    ftsearch ext would have to be a gem to get rid of the dups ruby/lib
    rake compiler?
    
    installing the Shoes.desktop file requires root priv. (fpm would be
    Ok since it's going to check for dependencies it has to sudo anyway)
  
  Loose Shoes Pi
    Gawd awful slow compile. Ruby is slow too (not the pi fp version?)
    Utf-8 and US-ASCII and .... Complier warnings and runtime.
    Lxterminal and even terminal(ssh) sometimes looses contact with rvm.
    Don't know how to create a desktop icon/menu link.  
    Many dependencies to apt-get (of course that fpm's job) but requiring
    ruby is a big thing on a slow machine.
    
  
  Tight Shoes Ubuntu
FIXED:    Compiling my own ruby (--enable-load-relative) fixes the duplicate
    rbconfig but ruby complains at startup 
    <internal:gem_prelude>:1:in `require': cannot load such file -- rubygems.rb (LoadError)
	from <internal:gem_prelude>:1:in `<compiled>'
    However, it can load gems (the Shoes built/dist ones and the stdlib)
    so the error message is mostly noise.
    
    Possible gem jail break scheme for tight shoes:
    Have to set the ": and 'require rubygems' 
FIXED: Sadly a gem load on that new path spits out those lovely 
    already initialized constants messages for .... guess who ?
      UTF_16BE, UTF_16LE, UTF_32BE, UTF_32LE
      
FIXED: Need to implement the standard Ruby directory layout. At startup
    Ruby determines the path to libruby.so and then it wants to load from
    lib/ruby/1.9.1 and lib/ruby/1.9.1/x86_64-linux. No amount of ln -s
    seems to convince ruby_init_loadpaths() otherwise.  
    1. copy /home/cross/{arch}/lib/[libruby.so.1.9.1] to {tgt} (x86_64-linux)
    2. ln -s libruby.so and libruby.so.1.9 to that
    3. copy /home/cross/{arch}/lib/ruby to {tgt}/ruby
    4. link libshoes.so as before, into {tgt}
    5  copy shoes.rb and shoes/ into {tgt}/lib
    6  may need to adjust shoes.c/world.c to load shoes.rb from there
    7  will need to fix cache.rb to include the dir with shoes.rb and 
       shoes/

    
  
  Tight Shoes Pi
    Need to cross compile many of the deps (jpeg, [un]gif, curl-dev and
    include them with Shoes. PITA but I had to do that with Mingw and 
    am still alive to remember it.
    
    I can also pkg-config on them using my copy of the Pi files. Which is
    what has to happen even if I built the damn things myself. And also 
    has to happen for any cross compiled Shoes with dependcies. 

==> The ubuntu cross compiler has a /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi and eahif 
    includes and libs. These need to be included (in the proper order)
==> Consider building a more complete toolchain for arm  and mingw
    (be nice if there was a pkg-config). There are more complete cross
    compiling systems that would help manage the dependencies. MXE for
    mingw, crosstoll-NG and CMake. CMake could/would replace the rakefiles
    
    Need to cross compile Ruby. Eventually. 
  
  All Shoes (Ruby 1.9.3, gtk2)
    The make/xarmv6-pi/env.rb executes the pkg-config on loading
    
  MingW32
    Not yet - there is enough to do with Linux.
  
  i686-linux
    I do have that Debian 7 32 bit virtual box so it could provide the 
    libs for cross compiling and to test things. 
    see cjc-configure.sh - just reverse build and host and build 32 bit
    with the 64 bit compiler.
